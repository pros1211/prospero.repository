            <h2 class="tips-title">Be Consistent</h2>
            <p class="description">When you have a consistent sleep schedule, your body naturally adjusts and begins to feel tired at just the right time each day. This cuts down the amount of time you’ll spend waiting to fall asleep and almost completely eliminates late-night insomnia.</p>
